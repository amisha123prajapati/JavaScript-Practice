    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you 
      must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set 
      of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. 
      This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you 
      made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state;</i> if 
      you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good 
      leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or 
      all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, 
      you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get 
      to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to continue the search 
      for a good leaf by revoking your <i>most recent</i> choice, and trying out the 
      next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice 
      that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the 
      root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
      <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
      <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
      <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
      <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
      <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
      <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
      <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>

    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model 
      of the possible sequences of choices</p>
