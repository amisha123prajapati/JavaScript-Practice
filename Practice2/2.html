    and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a 
    new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made.
     This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a
      good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't. </h1>
